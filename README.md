### Create and activate virtual environment with Python

For the managment of the dependencies, a virtual enviromnent is used.
- Open the `src` directory in a terminal
- Create virtual environment using the command `python -m venv signalflowgrapher`
- On Windows run `signalflowgrapher\Scripts\activate.bat` or `signalflowgrapher\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- On Unix or MacOS run `source signalflowgrapher/bin/activate`

### Create and activate virtual environment with Anaconda

For the managment of the dependencies, a virtual enviromnent is used.
- Open the `src` directory in an anaconda terminal
- Create virtual environment using command `conda create -n sfg`
- Activate virtual environment using the command `conda activate sfg`
- Install pip with `conda install pip`

### Restore dependencies

- Go to the the `signalflowgrapher` directory in a terminal or an anaconda terminal
- Run `pip install -r requirements/base.txt`

### Run application from terminal

- Go to the the `signalflowgrapher` directory in a terminal or an anaconda terminal
- Use `python .\src\main\python\main.py` to start the application

### Run unit tests and format tests

## User manual and tips

### Manual
There is none yet, but to familiarize yourself with signal-flow graphs, you can
- watch the signalflowgrapher intro video on https://tube.switch.ch/videos/609c0510
- Watch "Signal-Flow Graphs in 12 short lessons" on https://tube.switch.ch/channels/d206c96c?order=episodes
- Read our papers, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10470-018-1131-7 and http://rdcu.be/naw5 .

### Tips
- You can get nice SVG versions of the graphs by exporting TikZ, converting it to pdf with pdflatex, and then run https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg
